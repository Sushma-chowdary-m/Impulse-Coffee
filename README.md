# Impulse-Coffee
Coffee is one of the most popular drinks worldwide with around more than 2 billion cups consumed every day.
Since there are not much of flavored coffee available in the market, we are opening our shop “Impulse Coffee”
which would be in the heart of Bengaluru city, India. We specialize in creating premium coffee that comes in five
assorted flavors. Our coffee beans are harvested from one of the best coffee farms in Munnar, Kerala, and then
processed and flavored in our own mill. There is also a facility to have coffee at our cafe where customers can try
out assorted flavors. As our business expands, we need an efficient way to manage the coffee import, processing,
managing the flavor and ensuring timely inventory replacement.
The system would capture the data of the coffee beans being shipped from the farm, track the delivery system,
production of the coffee in our own mill which is a part of the shop, packaging, sales, and customer review. The
primary goal is to provide actionable insights for business growth, optimize operational efficiency, and enhance
customer satisfaction through informed decision-making.

In this project, we addressed seven key business goals by developing a series of SQL queries to analyze relevant data and provide insights for informed decision-making. The specific business goals we aimed to tackle were: 
1. To understand the coffee preferences of customers who prefer any flavor, aiding in personalized marketing
strategies, inventory management, and product recommendations.
2. Analysis of the top-selling coffee types and their distribution across different customer cities can help the
business identify new geographic markets with high demand for its popular coffee products. This
information can guide the company's expansion strategy, allowing it to open new retail locations or
distribution channels in these high-potential areas.
3. To identify the top-selling coffee based on transaction count, aiding in marketing strategies, and
understanding customer preferences.
4. To identify the most popular mode of payment among customers and understand individual customer
preferences, facilitating efficient payment processing to enhance for promotions by targeting specific
payment methods.
5. To identify customers who exclusively purchase dark roasted coffee, due to its premium pricing, this
analysis also allows for cost-cutting measures in the coffee shop if fewer customers are inclined towards
this product.
6. Analyze customer purchasing behavior for each coffee type within specific periods to identify seasonal
trends, quarterly performance, and the popularity of different coffee types over time. These insights
empower businesses to make data-driven decisions, fostering overall business development and growth.
7. To obtain a comprehensive overview of total sales revenue for each coffee type, facilitating a thorough
analysis of sales performance to inform decisions regarding pricing strategies.
8. To analyze the distribution of customers across different age groups and determine which age groups are
the most frequent consumers of coffee. This information can be valuable for targeted marketing
campaigns, product development, and understanding consumer behavior.
9. To identify preferred flavors among customers that do not correspond to any available coffee options. This
information can guide product development decisions and help in expanding the coffee menu to better
cater to customer preferences.
